# code doesn't work - bill always = 0 with this format
# turns out the code does work , just input correct caps or the order won't be taken
# modified by commenting out the separate pepperoni section and adding that to the pizza size
# pepperoni cost depends on pizza size so they should be nested here
# this entire program assume only ONE input so it is all just 'if' operators which is not optimal but works in this case though doesn't scale well
