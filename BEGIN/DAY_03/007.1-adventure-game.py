# create an adventure game flow chart which will be if and elif statements
# every choice is either a continue or a game over until you win which is the final step
# print the intro to the adventure game
# ask for input for directions - use word count to check for l or r, left or right


# pseudo code

input left or right - convert input to lower case and count the l or r as a valid characters
    if right
            print game over
        else
            swim or wait (same inputs conversion as above)
            if swim
                print game over
            else  (same inputs conversion as above)
                which door - red or white or yello
                if red or white 
                    print game over
                else
                    print you win
