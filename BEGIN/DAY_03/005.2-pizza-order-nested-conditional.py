# start with conditional statement using elif not nested (nested is ok but longer)

# then add a nested if / else statement for the pepperoni depending on size
# then add a  if statement for the cheese (just one option so no alternatives here)
# your inputs must exactly match the capital cases or will end up with the wrong sum bill
